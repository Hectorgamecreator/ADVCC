    <h1>What is Acceptance?</h1>
     <h2> We come to terms with our grief and accept our loss. Accepting a loss doesn’t necessarily mean the person is no longer grieving. In fact, many grief experts say that grief can continue for a lifetime after a major loss, and coping with the loss only becomes easier over time. Anything can trigger your grief when it happened and long after the person “accepted” it.</h2>

  <h2><a  href= "https://www.greatlakespsychologygroup.com/grief/blurred-line-grief-depression/"> Grief </a>  is a personal, nuanced, and complicated process; it will not look the same for any two people who are grieving. However, those who are grieving may experience similar emotions along the way.</h2>
