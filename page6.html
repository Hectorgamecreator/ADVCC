    <h1> What is bargaining?</h1>
 </section>

<h2>In this stage, we are tired of feeling anger. Your mood shift into reasoning why did the truth come out like this. For example, a religious person who loved one is dying might seek to negotiate with God to keep the person alive. Bargaining may help the grieving person cope by allowing them a sense of control in face of helplessness.</h2>
