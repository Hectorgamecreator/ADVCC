    <h2> When we lose someone or something important to us, it is natural to reject the idea that it could be true. 
        <h2>We may isolate ourselves to avoid facing the truth.</h2>
        <h2> Friends and family would try to comfort us at our dark times and it may hurt us more while we are still coming to terms with the loss.  </h2>
